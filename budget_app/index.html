A child born in britain today should have the opportunity to become anything they want to an olympian a scientist a
firefighter the prime minister the head of state unfortunately no person no
matter how intelligent and talented can ever become the head of state a position given to a royal as a birthright the
british public is deferent to a monarch that we have not elected and may never have the chance to become the monarch is
born superior to us all and we are subjects not citizens the organization for economic cooperation and development says
britain has the worst social mobility in the western world but the royals are value for money the official reported cost
to the british public is around 40 million per year add on to that the 24-hour security plus the cost of hosting the
royals and according to the lobby group republic we can
estimate the real figure to be closer to 202.4 million that's the approximate cost of over 9
000 nurses 8 000 policemen or one monarch to open business parks the royal wedding alone was a seven million pound
security operation paid for entirely out of the existing police budgets but the royals create public income from the
duchies of cornwall lancaster and the crown estate true the royal property portfolio is worth over seven billion pounds
and includes key urban developments historical buildings much of the uk's farmland seabed and coastline this includes
all whales and dolphins this portfolio earned the state an estimated 230 million pounds a year but how did the royal
family come to own this land and why isn't it the property of the public why is this land exempt from inheritance tax
unlike the land belonging to us commoners in return for a small profit we forfeit our right to aspire by valuing
inherent privilege of actual talent but the monarch has no real power then why have one why have a dated undemocratic
system that favors bloodline over ability what about the power to appoint a prime minister to dissolve parliament and
the royal ascent in which a monarch formally approves the acts of parliament passing
them into law the monarch will never use these powers if they did there will be a revolution then why give an unelected
head of state powers absolutely vital to our democracy on the basis that they are never used under any circumstance did
you know the royals currently enjoy protection from the freedom of information act and have the ability to lobby the
government on political issues what about the good work the royals do for the country nurses school teachers scientists
and care workers do good work for the country the monarchy is good for tourism people come to visit the historical
castles and palaces not to have tea with a monarch take buckingham palace it is closed to the public for most of the
year and when open visitors can only see a fraction of the grounds compare this to the louvre in paris formerly the
palace of the french royal family and now one of the world's leading museums attracting 8.5 million tourists per year
buckingham palace attracts 0.4 million logic suggests that opening the whole of buckingham palace and its gardens all
year round would increase tourism but the louvre does have some of the world's greatest masterpieces so does the royal
family owning one of the largest art collections in the world with pieces by rembrandt rubens raphael and tisian at an
estimated value of 10 billion pounds if only we had a big empty building in the capital to display and maintain them
